**Learn DeFi curation from proven strategies.**

We build learning tools for the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Our mission is to teach users *how to think* about yield strategies—not just show them data.

## What We're Building

**[fabrknt.com](https://www.fabrknt.com)** — A DeFi curation learning platform that helps you build real allocation skills:

- **Curation Principles** — Six mental models that guide professional curators
- **Curator Strategies** — See how Gauntlet, Steakhouse, and RE7 allocate—and *why*
- **Strategy Builder** — Practice building allocations with real-time feedback
- **Scenario Simulator** — Stress test strategies before committing capital
- **Educational Tools** — Protocol comparisons, LST analysis, IL calculators

### Origin Story Tweet

```
Why I'm building @fabrknt:

Came from banking. We never invested without testing first.

But in DeFi? "Here's a 50% APY, trust me bro."

So I built a way to paper trade DeFi strategies risk-free.

Try → Track → Trust → Trade

No more blind trust.
```

---

### Building in Public Tweet

```
Building @fabrknt in public.

Users can now:
• Get allocation in 30 sec
• Track performance over 14+ days
• See APY trends with sparklines
• Build trust before investing

The "Trust" in Try → Track → Trust → Trade.
```

---

### Philosophy Tweet

```
Hot take: The best DeFi tool is one you can verify before using.

That's why @fabrknt lets you paper trade first.

If our recommendations don't perform, you'll know—before losing money.

Accountability through transparency.
```

---

### Personal + Product Tweet

```
After 15+ years in banking and enterprise software, one thing is clear:

Trust is earned, not assumed.

@fabrknt applies this to DeFi:
• Get personalized allocation
• Paper trade it
• Watch it perform
• Invest when YOU'RE ready

Try → Track → Trust → Trade
```

---

### Problem Observation Tweet

```
The problem with DeFi yields:

You don't know if they're real until you've risked real money.

@fabrknt fixes this.

Paper trade first. Track for 14+ days. See actual performance.

Then decide if you want to invest.

Revolutionary? No. Just common sense.
```

---

### Institutional vs Retail Tweet

```
Institutional finance: "Show me the backtest before I invest."

Retail DeFi: "Number go up, ape in."

@fabrknt brings institutional rigor to everyone.

Paper trade your allocation. Verify it works. Then invest.

Try → Track → Trust → Trade

## Thread: The FABRKNT Story

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
Why I built @fabrknt — a thread 🧵

I spent 15+ years in banking and enterprise software.

One thing was always true: you never invest without testing first.

Due diligence. Backtesting. Paper trading. Small position tests.

Then DeFi happened.
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
In DeFi, the standard is:

"Here's a 50% APY. Deposit now. Trust me bro."

No verification. No testing. Just vibes and hope.

I lost money learning this lesson.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
So I built what I wished existed:

A way to get personalized DeFi allocations AND test them before risking real money.

Try → Track → Trust → Trade

Get allocation in 30 seconds.
Paper trade it.
Watch performance for 14+ days.
Invest when confident.
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
The Paper Portfolio Dashboard shows:

• Your paper value over time
• APY trends (rising/falling/stable)
• Trust progress (14-day target)
• Estimated yields

All without risking a single dollar.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```

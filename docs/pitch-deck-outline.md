# FABRKNT Pitch Deck Outline

*For Colosseum Hackathons (multi-track submission)*

---

## Slide Structure

### Slide 1: Title
**FABRKNT**
Paper Trade DeFi Before You Risk Real Money

*Try → Track → Trust → Trade*

- Logo
- Website: fabrknt.com
- Tagline: "The trust layer for DeFi yields"

---

### Slide 2: The Problem

**DeFi requires blind trust**

| What They Say | What Happens |
|---------------|--------------|
| "50% APY, trust me" | Rug pull |
| "Safe vault, deposit now" | Smart contract hack |
| "Here's 500 pools" | Analysis paralysis |

- Users can't verify strategies before investing
- No way to test without risking real money
- Institutions backtest everything; retail gets "trust me bro"

*Visual: Split screen - institutional due diligence vs retail "ape in"*

---

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Try → Track → Trust → Trade**

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Try** | Get personalized allocation | 30 seconds |
| **Track** | Paper Portfolio Dashboard | Ongoing |
| **Trust** | Watch real performance | 14+ days |
| **Trade** | Execute when confident | Your choice |

*Visual: Journey flow diagram with icons*

**Key insight**: Trust is earned, not assumed.

---

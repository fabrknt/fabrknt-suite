## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** FABRKNT Suite

**Concept:** A Web3 Index & Synergy platform built for **early verification**. We help **Web3 Corp Dev teams, investors, and founders** verify companies using real on-chain activity, GitHub signals, and social data — fully automated, no self-reporting.

**Products:** Two integrated products: **INDEX** (Web3 Company Verification) and **SYNERGY** (Quiet M&A & Partnerships). INDEX provides automated verification that shows what Web3 companies actually do — not what they say. SYNERGY leverages INDEX data to enable acquisition targets and partnership opportunities — without broadcasting intent.

**Architecture:** **Index → Synergy** - Index serves as the data foundation that powers Synergy's synergy and decision-making capabilities. Every Synergy listing is backed by verified Index data, ensuring transparency and trust.

**Positioning:** **AI × SME Specialization × Integrated Advisory** - Maximizing automation through AI to drastically improve the cost and time efficiency of M&A and partnership processes in the Web3 market, where information asymmetry is high.

## 2. Market Opportunity

### Web3 Market Growth

The Web3 market is estimated to be between **$3.47 billion and $7.23 billion** as of 2025, with projections to expand to **$41.4 billion – $42.3 billion by 2030** (CAGR of approximately 42%–45%).

### SME Segment Opportunity

The growth rate of SMEs within the Web3 market is particularly noteworthy. While large enterprises currently lead with a 60.9% market share, the **SME segment is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 54.6% through 2030**, outstripping the pace of large corporations.

-   **Active Seed and Small-Scale Deals:** Approximately 36.4% of funding rounds are concentrated in the $1M to $5M range, making the seed round the most active phase.
-   **The Necessity of Consolidation:** Many small projects face resource shortages and intensifying competition. We have entered a "Consolidation Phase" where SMEs with high technical capabilities are being absorbed into larger ecosystems.

### Global Market Positioning

The platform serves the global Web3 ecosystem, focusing on SMEs that require efficient, data-driven M&A and partnership processes. As the market moves from "speculation to utility" and "isolation to integration," an infrastructure where AI bridges the gap between technology and business based on data is indispensable for the development of the global Web3 ecosystem.

## 3. AI Automation & Efficiency

The vision of "maximizing automation through AI" drastically improves the cost and time efficiency of traditional M&A processes in the Web3 market.

### Quantitative Evaluation of AI-Driven Efficiency

-   **Accelerated Sourcing and Evaluation:** By using AI algorithms to identify targets, the time required to locate and evaluate companies can be reduced by **over 50%**.
-   **High-Speed Document Processing:** AI agents utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) can process thousands of financial and legal documents in minutes to extract inconsistencies or legal risks. This shortens the review period for mid-market deals from weeks to days.
-   **Democratization of Technical Evaluation:** AI auditing tools detect smart contract vulnerabilities and assign security scores (0–100%). Furthermore, they translate complex code into language understandable by non-technical investors and executives.

### Three-Tier Data Integration

AI seamlessly combines three layers of data to provide a holistic view:

1. **On-chain:** Real-time monitoring of "Smart Money" movements and TVL trends via APIs (e.g., Nansen, Dune). Verified on-chain protocol fees, transaction volumes, and wallet quality metrics.
2. **Off-chain:** Traditional financial and legal information, GitHub activity, team contribution data, and service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU).
3. **Online:** Sentiment analysis to distinguish between bot activity (airdrop farming) and genuine community growth. Social media metrics and community engagement data.

## 4. Platform Architecture: Index → Synergy

The platform operates on a two-tier architecture where **Index** serves as the data foundation that powers **Synergy**.

### 4.1. INDEX: Web3 Company Verification

**INDEX** is an automated index that shows what Web3 companies actually do — not what they say.

**What we verify:**

-   **On-chain growth**  
    Wallet activity, protocol usage, real traction

-   **Team & code health**  
    GitHub commits, contributors, retention, code quality

-   **Signal integrity**  
    Cross-verified via blockchain and public APIs

**If it can't be verified, it doesn't count.**

**The "Fabrknt Score":** An aggregate index score (0-100) calculated from:

-   **Growth Score:** On-chain conversion efficiency, wallet quality, and service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU)
-   **Team Health Score:** Team contribution consistency and developer activity
-   **Revenue Verification:** Verified on-chain protocol fees or Stripe data

**Key Features:**

-   Automated analysis of on-chain data, GitHub activity, and social metrics
-   Real-time monitoring and updates
-   Comprehensive company directory with verified index scores
-   Transparent, auditable data sources

### 4.2. SYNERGY: Quiet M&A & Partnerships

**SYNERGY** enables discovery of acquisition targets and partnership opportunities — without broadcasting intent.

**Built for:**

-   Corp Dev teams scouting quietly
-   Strategic partnerships and integrations
-   Ecosystem collaborations
-   Early M&A conversations

**Key Features:**

-   **Automated Data Import:** Listings automatically pull verified index data from INDEX—no manual entry required
-   **The "Audit View":** Buyers can deep-dive into the raw index data without leaving the SYNERGY interface
-   **AI-Powered Synergy:** Automated compatibility analysis based on **verified index scores**, not narratives
-   **One-Click NDA:** Buyers sign an on-chain message to unlock "Privileged Data" (GitHub private repos, specific smart contract addresses)
-   **Proof of Funds (PoF):** Access to high-value listings is gated by a wallet-balance check to ensure only serious buyers engage

### 4.3. Partnership & Collaboration Synergy

Beyond M&A transactions, **Synergy** serves as a comprehensive "synergy platform" for the Web3 ecosystem:

-   **Business Synergy:** Connect companies seeking infrastructure with SMEs possessing specific tech stacks (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs, DePIN)
-   **Technology-Complementary Alliances:** Synergy companies based on complementary capabilities and technical requirements, using Index data to assess compatibility
-   **Partnership Types:** Support for technical, strategic, marketing, and ecosystem partnerships
-   **Post-Alliance Monitoring:** AI continuously analyzes on-chain activity post-partnership using Index data to visualize and evaluate synergies, such as increases in user count or transaction volume

### 4.4. Transaction Protocol (The Deal Protocol)

-   **Atomic Escrow:** A smart contract-based swap where the purchase price (Stablecoins) is exchanged for project assets.
-   **Asset Packaging:**
    -   **Smart Contract Ownership:** Transfer of `Admin/Owner` roles.
    -   **Digital Assets:** ENS domains, GitHub organization access, and Social accounts.
